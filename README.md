# Portfolio Website

This project is a personal portfolio website built with Angular. It showcases my work experience, projects, and articles.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Responsive Design

This project uses a `ScreenSizeService` to manage responsive design. The service uses the `@angular/cdk/layout`'s `BreakpointObserver` to determine the screen size and apply the appropriate styles.
