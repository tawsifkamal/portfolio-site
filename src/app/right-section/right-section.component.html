  <div class="about-me" id="ABOUT">
    Hey! I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student at Georgia Tech with a
    concentration in AI and Networking. I'm currently interning as a Machine Learning
    Developer &#64; IBM and have previously worked at NCR and LogicomUSA as a Fullstack Developer. I
    also help make apps for non-profits at my school club Bits of Good.<br /><br />

    My journey involves learning and exploring the fundamentals behind Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).  In my current internship, I'm diving into the intricacies of Kubernetes and LLMOps infrastructure. I'm equally
    fascinated by the nuances of full-stack development, continually exploring
    Angular, Vue, React and the subtle differences between frontend/backend
    frameworks. <br /><br />

    When I'm not at the computer, you can find me experimenting with my camera,
    hitting the gym, or eating out!
